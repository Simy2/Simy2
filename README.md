### Hi I'm Simy 👋

My name is Jaeyoun Sim, also known as Simy. Simy is the abbreviation of my name.

I'm interested in Backend development, Data structures, and quantitative investment. Additionally, I have strong language skills, as evidenced by my OPIC certification with an IH level, which enhances my ability to collaborate effectively with international teams.

My goal is to create a programs or code that generate high revenue.
However, I haven’t been interested in quant for long, so I’m not very knowledgeable about it yet.
